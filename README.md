### 2. Sending Emails

**Using JavaMail API**
The JavaMail API provides a set of classes and interfaces to send emails programmatically. You can use the javax.mail package to establish a connection with an email server and send emails.

**Configuring SMTP Server**
To send emails, you need to configure the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server settings, such as the host, port, and authentication credentials. Consult your email service provider's documentation to obtain the required SMTP server details.

**Sending Plain Text and HTML Emails**
Using the JavaMail API, you can send both plain text and HTML-formatted emails. You can create a MimeMessage object, set the sender, recipient, subject, content type, and content of the email.

**Adding Attachments**
To add attachments to an email, you can use the MimeBodyPart class to represent the email body and attachments. Attachments can be added as MimeBodyPart objects and then added to a Multipart object, which is then set as the content of the email.

### 3. Email Automation

**Sending Automated Emails**
Email automation involves programmatically sending emails based on certain triggers or events. You can integrate email-sending logic into your Java application or use scheduling libraries like Quartz or Spring Scheduler to send emails at specific intervals or based on predefined conditions.

**Scheduled Email Tasks**
Scheduled email tasks allow you to send emails automatically at specified times or intervals. By utilizing scheduling libraries, you can set up recurring tasks to send emails periodically or trigger email sending based on specific events or conditions.
